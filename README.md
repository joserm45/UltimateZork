# UltimateZork
First Proyect.

Problems:

I will try to create a game similar to Zork. At the first part i got too much problems that i try to solve. I know that this is not easier but sometimes
 i think that all this is so big for me... I had to answere some of things to my partner. The big problem i think that i need more time programming but sometimes when 
i did it, i'm unable to get ideas to resolve the problem. I really enjoy programming when i know what i need to do, but usually i beeing frustrated. 


Done:
 
You can move around a map uploaded on the wiki. Also you can write the Commands: north,south,east,west ; n/s/e/w and go north/n,south/s etc.
At latest you can write the comand help to see all the commands on the game, and the command open north/n etc. to open the rooms...
quit==finish the game..
Also you can pick drop equip and unequip items. All of these items are on the first room to do more easier the search. with writting inventory/inv/i you will display the items that u have.
